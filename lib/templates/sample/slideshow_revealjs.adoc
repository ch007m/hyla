= Getting Started with Reveal.js

== Reveal.js

HTML Presentations Made Easy

+++<small>+++
Created by {blog}[{author}] / http://twitter.com/{twitter}[@{twitter}]#
+++</small>+++

== Heads Up

reveal.js is a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. You'll need a browser with
support for CSS 3D transforms to see it in its full glory.

+++<aside class="notes">+++
Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
+++</aside>+++

== Vertical Slides

DOES NOT WORK AS IT IMPLIED TO HAVE A SECTION NESTED IN ANOTHER SECTION
Slides can be nested inside of other slides,
try pressing +++<a href="#" class="navigate-down">+++down+++</a>+++.

+++
<a href="#" class="image navigate-down">
    <img width="178" height="238" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png" alt="Down arrow">
</a>
+++

== Basement Level 1

Press down or up to navigate.

== Slides

Not a coder? No problem. There's a fully-featured visual editor for authoring these, try it out at http://slid.es[http://slid.es, window="_blank"].

== Point of View

Press **ESC** to enter the slide overview.
Hold down alt and click on any element to zoom in on it using http://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js[zoom.js].
Alt + click anywhere to zoom back out.

== Marvelous Unordered List

- No order here
- Or here
- Or here
- Or here

== Fantastic Ordered List

[numbered]
. One is smaller than...
. Two is smaller than...
. Three!

== Transition Styles

You can select from different transitions, like:

link:?transition=cube#/transitions[Cube] -
link:?transition=page#/transitions[Page] -
link:?transition=concave#/transitions[Concave] -
link:?transition=zoom#/transitions[Zoom] -
link:?transition=linear#/transitions[Linear] -
link:?transition=fade#/transitions[Fade] -
link:?transition=none#/transitions[None] -
link:?#/transitions[Default]


== Themes

Reveal.js comes with a few themes built in:

link:?#/themes[Default] -
link:?theme=sky#/themes[Sky] -
link:?theme=beige#/themes[Beige] -
link:?theme=simple#/themes[Simple] -
link:?theme=serif#/themes[Serif] -
link:?theme=night#/themes[Night] +++<br>+++
link:?theme=moon#/themes[Moon] -
link:?theme=solarized#/themes[Solarized]

+++<small>+++
* Theme demos are loaded after the presentation which leads to flicker. +
In production you should load your theme in the <code><head></code> using a <code><link></code>.
+++</small>+++

== Global State

Set +++data-state="something"+++ on a slide and +
+++"something"+++ will be added as a class to the document +
element when the slide is open. This lets you apply broader style +
changes, like switching the background.

== Custom Events

Additionally custom events can be triggered on a per slide basis by binding to the +++data-state+++ name.

[source, java]
Reveal.addEventListener( 'customevent', function() {
  console.log( '"customevent" has fired' );
} );

[data-background=#007777]
== Slide Backgrounds

Set +++data-background="#007777"+++ on a slide to change the full page background to the given color.
All CSS color formats are supported.

Put macro block with data-background attribute just before the title of the slide which corresponds to the section tag
used by Reveal

```
[data-background=#007777]
== Slide Backgrounds
```

[data-background="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png"]
== Image Backgrounds

```
[data-background=image.png]
== Image Backgrounds
```

[data-background="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png", data-background-repeat="repeat", data-background-size="100px"]
== REPEATED IMAGE BACKGROUNDS

```
[data-background="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png", data-background-repeat="repeat", data-background-size="100px"]
== REPEATED IMAGE BACKGROUNDS
```

[data-transition="linear", data-background="#4d7e65", data-background-transition="slide"]
== Background Transitions

Pass reveal.js the +++backgroundTransition: 'slide'+++ config argument to make backgrounds slide rather than fade.

[data-transition="linear", data-background="#8c4738", data-background-transition="slide"]
== Background Transition Override

You can override background transitions per slide by using +++[data-background-transition="slide"].

== Clever Quotes

These guys come in two forms, inline: ``__The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from
__'' and block:

``__For years there has been a theory that millions of monkeys typing at random on millions of typewriters would
  reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare. The Internet has proven this theory to be untrue.__''

== Pretty Code

[source, javascript, source-highlighter=highlightjs]
----
function linkify( selector ) {
  if( supports3DTransforms ) {

    var nodes = document.querySelectorAll( selector );

    for( var i = 0, len = nodes.length; i &lt; len; i++ ) {
      var node = nodes[i];

      if( !node.className ) {
        node.className += ' roll';
      }
    }
  }
}
