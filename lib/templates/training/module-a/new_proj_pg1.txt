== Admonition

NOTE: This is an example note 1.

TIP: The use of Strings instead of Integers is intentional.  The variables will be used in a later lab as fields in an HTML form that passes values as HTTP GET parameters.  These are always Strings.  This means that means that any process variable set directly (age, numberOfAccidents, numberOfTickets, vehicleYear) or indirectly (price, as it's derived from taskPrice) through the forms must be declared as String.

WARNING: DO NOT use the generate task form templates button.  If used, it will overwrite all the form in your process instead of just the new form.
